# Harry Potter Theme Audio File

To add the Harry Potter theme (Hedwig's Theme) as your alarm sound:

1. Download the Harry Potter theme song (MP3 or OGG format)
2. Rename it to `alarm.mp3` 
3. Place it in this `static` folder

For now, I'll create a simple beep-based alarm that you can replace later.

Alternatively, you can find royalty-free versions at:
- YouTube Audio Library
- Free Music Archive
- Or use a Harry Potter-themed sound effect

The code will look for `static/alarm.mp3` to play as the alarm ringtone.
